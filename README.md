_RiQochet is currently under active development and not well tested. Use at your own risk._

## Usage

### RIQ_FIELD

RIQ_FIELD is a formula created by the sheet that allows you to get a field from an object (e.g. the number of employees a prospect has).

```
=RIQ_FIELD("List Object Name", "Field Name")
=RIQ_FIELD("ACME Inc", "Number of Employees")
=RIQ_FIELD($A2, B$1) 
```
